Instructions

Use this rubric for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are object-oriented - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions. Also make sure that the keyword this is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your README.md file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this guide.
